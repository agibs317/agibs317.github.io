        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Tanzania contains some of Africaâ€™s most iconic national parks and
          famous paleoanthropological sites, and its diverse cultural heritage
          reflects the multiple ethnolinguistic groups that live in the country.
          Its long history of integration into trade networks spanning the
          Indian Ocean and the African interior led to the development of
          Swahili as a common language in much of east Africa and the
          introduction of Islam into the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          A number of independent coastal and island trading posts in what is
          now Tanzania came under Portuguese control after <time datetime="1498">1498</time> when they began
          to take control of much of the coast and Indian Ocean trade. By <time datetime="1700">1700</time>,
          the Sultanate of Oman had become the dominant power in the region
          after ousting the Portuguese who were also facing a series of local
          uprisings.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the following hundred years, Zanzibar - an archipelago off the
          coast of Tanzania - became a hub of Indian Ocean trade, with Arab and
          Indian traders establishing and consolidating trade routes with
          communities in mainland Tanzania that contributed to the expansion of
          the slave trade. Zanzibar briefly become the capital of the Sultanate
          of Oman before it split into separate Omani and Zanzibar Sultanates in
          <time datetime="1856">1856</time>. Beginning in the mid-1800s, European explorers, traders, and
          Christian missionaries became more active in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Germans eventually established control over mainland Tanzania -
          which they called Tanganyika - and the British established control
          over Zanzibar. Tanganyika later came under British administration
          after the German defeat in World War I. Tanganyika gained independence
          from Great Britain in <time datetime="1961">1961</time>, and Zanzibar followed in <time datetime="1963">1963</time> as a
          constitutional monarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Tanganyika, Julius Nyerere, a charismatic and idealistic socialist,
          established a one-party political system that centralized power and
          encouraged national self-reliance and rural development. In <time datetime="1964">1964</time>, a
          popular uprising overthrew the Sultan in Zanzibar and either killed or
          expelled many of the Arabs and Indians who had dominated the isles for
          more than 200 years. Later that year, Tanganyika and Zanzibar combined
          to form the United Republic of Tanzania, but Zanzibar retained
          considerable autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their two ruling parties combined to form the <abbr title="Chama Cha Mapinduzi">CCM</abbr> party in 
          <time datetime="1977">1977</time>. Nyerere handed over power to Ali Hassan Mwinyi in
          <time datetime="1985">1985</time> and remained CCM chair until <time datetime="1990">1990</time>. Tanzania held its first
          multi-party elections in <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, but CCM candidates have continued to
          dominate politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Political opposition in Zanzibar has led to four contentious elections
          since <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, in which the ruling party claimed victory despite
          international observers' claims of voting irregularities. In <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, 35
          people in Zanzibar died when soldiers fired on protestors following
          the <time datetime="2000">2000</time> election.
        </p>
        <p>
          John Magufuli won the <time datetime="2015">201</time>5 presidential election, and the CCM won a
          two-thirds majority in Parliament. He was reelected in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> and the
          CCM increased its majority in an election that was also critiqued by
          observers. Magufuli died in <time datetime="2021-03">March 2021</time> while in office and was
          constitutionally succeeded by his vice president, Samia Suluhu Hassan.

          <p>
            Tanzania is a significant transit country for illicit drugs in East
            Africa. International drug-trafficking organizations and courier
            networks transit through Tanzania to smuggle heroin and
            methamphetamine from Southwest Asia. Tanzania produces cannabis
            products and khat for domestic consumption and regional and
            international distribution. Traffickers influence politicians, law
            enforcement, and others in positions of power with money. (<time datetime="2021">2021</time>)
